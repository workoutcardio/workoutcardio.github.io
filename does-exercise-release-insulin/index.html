PPT Metabolic effects of Insulin and Glucagon Metabolism in the Well From slideserve.com
The blood sugar levels rise when the pancreas becomes insufficient to release insulin or does not release insulin at all. Physical activity has a significant positive effect on insulin sensitivity. If you become desensitized to insulin the key does not unlock the door efficiently and blood sugar levels become disrupted. Physical activity has a significant positive effect on insulin sensitivity.

<p>This decrease in insulin does not impede muscle glucose uptake which occurs via mechanisms independent of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that is normally released by the beta cells of the pancreas. Insulin sensitivity also increases after exercise and remains elevated for about 24 hours in most individuals.
