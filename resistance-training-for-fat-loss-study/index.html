Influence of Weight Loss, Resistance Training, and Aerobic Training on From rheumatologyadvisor.com
Remember, i started this blog with a study that showed how resistance training sets the cells up for burning body fat. Inactive adults experience a 3% to 8% loss of muscle mass per decade, accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat accumulation. Cc0 public domain findings from a new university. Increasing muscle size through resistance training increases rmr, thereby increasing or sustaining fat loss over time.

<p>Increasing muscle size through resistance training increases rmr, thereby increasing or sustaining fat loss over time. The resistance and aerobic group lost on average 9.5kg over the 12 week period. Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. Background resistance training is the gold standard exercise mode for accrual of lean muscle mass, but the isolated effect of resistance training on body fat is unknown. Aerobic exercise 'better' than resistance training for weight loss.</p>
