Examples of Moderate and Vigorous Physical Activity Obesity From hsph.harvard.edu
Vigorous intensity is a term used to define the level of physical activity characteristic of a particular exercise. Intensity of exercise is the most elusive of these elements and yet has important implications for the health benefits and particularly cardiovascular outcomes elicited by regular physical activity. Exercise intense enough to cause sweating and/or heavy breathing, and/or increase of heart rate to near maximum. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour,health behaviours and risk factors.
