<p>Once you know your threshold heart rate, follow these percentages to pinpoint your heart rate training zones: Endurance horses must attain heart rates below a certain limit (usually 64 beats/min) to pass veterinary inspections in endurance rides. The data from a heart rate monitor lags, and really cannot capture the stop and go efforts within cycling. Normally, the heart rate is controlled by a cluster of cells called the sinoatrial (sa) node.</p>
