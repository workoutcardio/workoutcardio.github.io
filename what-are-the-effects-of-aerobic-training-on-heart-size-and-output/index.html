The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise training on maximum aerobic capacity, resting heart rate (rhr), blood pressure and anthropometric variables of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. However, as shown in figure 1 , men and women did not differ in their increased aerobic capacity after. Therefore, your heart can maintain a high cardiac output with less effort. An increased pulmonary capillary blood volume at rest is associated with a higher v̇o2 max.

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise training on maximum aerobic capacity, resting heart rate (rhr), blood pressure and anthropometric variables of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. By maintaining the aerobic phase of exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a week, the cardiorespiratory system can improve in. In addition, the lower aerobic capacity observed in hfpef may be due to impaired both convective and diffusive o 2 transport (i.e. Objective to study the effects of aerobic exercise on exercise cardiac output and related parameters in patients with chronic heart failure (chf).
