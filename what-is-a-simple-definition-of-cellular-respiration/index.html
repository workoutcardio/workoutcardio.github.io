Cell Respiration Process ABC Worksheet From abcworksheet.com
Cellular respiration definition, the oxidation of organic compounds that occurs within cells, producing energy for cellular processes. In the absence of oxygen. Oxidation of pyruvate is the second step of aerobic respiration occurring, representing one. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of animals, plants, and fungi, and also in algae and other protists.
