Definition Of Physical Fitness definitoin From definitoin.blogspot.com
The pursuit of improved quality of life, personal growth, and potential through positive lifestyle practices and attitudes is known as wellness. Physical fitness relates to the physiological body&#39;s ability to accomplish exercises demanding muscle endurance and strength. Physically healthy people have a lower risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even some cancers. A further way of looking at physical conditioning is to quantify the effectiveness of organ systems, like the circulatory or respiratory system.
