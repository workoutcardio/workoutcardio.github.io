<p>How does deep breathing affect office blood pressure and pulse rate? Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles. Calculate the difference in wrist pulse and blood pressure before and after the deep breathing exercise. Take the subject’s wrist pulse and blood pressure again after the breathing exercises and record the date. Heart Rate Body Systems and energy for physical activity.</p>
