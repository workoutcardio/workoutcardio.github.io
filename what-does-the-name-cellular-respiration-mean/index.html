Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, the citric acid cycle. A catabolic process (see catabolism) occurring in cells where complex organic molecules are broken down to release energy for other cellular processes. Cellular respiration synonyms, cellular respiration pronunciation, cellular respiration translation, english dictionary definition of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms (both plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and then release waste products.
