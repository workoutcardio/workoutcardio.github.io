<p>The combination of one xylem and one phloem strand adjacent to each other is known as a vascular. They are predominant land plants, some of which are as tall as 100 metres and as old as 6000 years. Vascular plants are those plants in which vascular tissue in the form of xylem and phloem is present. The plant vascular system is a complicated network of conducting tissues that interconnects all organs and transports water, minerals, nutrients, organic compounds, and various signaling molecules throughout the plant body.</p>
