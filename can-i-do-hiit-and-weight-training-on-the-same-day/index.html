<p>Taken together, the evidence suggests that yes, hiit really could help you burn more fat faster than regular exercise. If i want to include hiit into my training to loose fat, would it be possible to do it on the same day as weightlifting (obviously not on leg day). Most individuals who do so perform two separate training sessions on the same day to allow for recovery between sessions. So, resting at least 6 hours between sessions seems to be optimal for strength adaptations if doing combined resistance and hiit training on the same day.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do both weight training and hiit on the same day. Start with regular hiit, then experiment with tabata. For instance, training a muscle group to failure multiple times during an intense hiit session (i.e., performing multiple sets of pushups to failure in quick succession) will always have some degree of carryover into muscle building potential. Research shows that combined training is not detrimental to muscle gains. HIIT vs Steady State Cardio The Battle for Weight Loss Dark Iron Fitness.</p>
