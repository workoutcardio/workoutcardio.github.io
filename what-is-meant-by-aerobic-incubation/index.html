<p>An aerobic environment is characterized by the presence of free oxygen (o2) while an anaerobic environment lacks free oxygen but may contain atomic oxygen bound in compounds such as nitrate (no3), nitrite (no2), and sulfites (so3). Aerobes are microbes that require o2 as their terminal electron acceptor, but. This difference is due to a fact that the growth of putrefactive bacteria such as coliforms and clostridium spp. The provision of proper conditions for growth and development, as for bacterial or tissue cultures.

<p>This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. In this process, water and carbon dioxide are produced as end products. In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. For growing aerobic microorganisms, i prepared conical flasks which covered with cotton at top.
