Long and short term effects of exercise efintheline From efintheline.wordpress.com
The change in activity will also affect your muscles and the circulatory system. During physical exercise, more oxygen is needed for energy production. In the short term (8 weeks after infarction), training increased rrsd by 25% (p &lt; 0.01), mssd by 69% (p &lt; 0.01), pnn50 by 120% (p &lt; 0.01), and reduced lf/hf ratio by 30% (p &lt; 0.01). O2 can now be diffused into the muscle from the capillaries more.

<p>O2 can now be diffused into the muscle from the capillaries more. As the review authors point out, there is a strong relationship between resting heart rate and life expectancy.

<p>Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen.

<p>In the short term, exercise can also help to increase energy levels and reduce stress levels. Normally, the heart rate will increase. The intensity of physical activity determines how much the heart rate will increase. When you exercise regularly more blood is pumped out of the heart and into the body.

<p>The change in activity will also affect your muscles and the circulatory system. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. During physical exercise, more oxygen is needed for energy production. Figure 1 from Effects of Moderate Exercise on Short Term Memory An.</p>
