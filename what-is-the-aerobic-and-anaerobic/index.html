They cannot tolerate oxygen at all and will die if exposed to an environment that has a high quantity of oxygen. Aerobic and anaerobic refer to biological processes that use oxygen and do not use oxygen, respectively. Another key difference is the fact that higher organisms have aerobic respiration whereas in lower organisms anaerobic respiration occurs. Aerobic refers to a process that uses oxygen.

<p>But, if your primary concern is shedding fat, anaerobic exercise is the way to go. When a cell needs to release energy, the cytoplasm (a substance between a cell's nucleus and its membrane) and mitochondria (organelles in cytoplasm that help with metabolic processes) initiate chemical exchanges that launch the breakdown of glucose. Aerobic respiration is the most common type of respiration. High intensity interval training (hiit). Anaerobic v Aerobic Exercises &amp; Benefits The Chief Life.</p>

<p>Furthermore, glucose is the main form of simple organic compound in both cellular respiration. Energy for sit is produced via both the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways and is potentially an effective means of increasing endurance performance. Anaerobic bacteria are microorganisms that survive in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to function. Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Exercise What’s the Difference?
