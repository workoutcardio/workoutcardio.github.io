When we lift weights, we are damaging muscle tissue, crating little tears in the fibers to be built back up with the carbs. By doing 40 minutes of cardio five times a week or more, you&#39;ll be getting at least 200 minutes of exercise. It might seem like you need superhuman motivation to work out every day, but it gives you more chances to torch calories than putting in a few days per week. Make the necessary adjustments to your calorie intake.
