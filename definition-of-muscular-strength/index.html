<p>Muscular strength is defined as the ability of your nervous and muscular systems to produce enough force in your connective tissues and muscles to move an external force, such as weight or your body against gravity. While endurance is all about how long a muscle can perform, muscular strength is how hard it can perform. Muscular strength is an important part of overall wellness and can improve your health, in addition to boosting your confidence. Muscle weakness or imbalance can result in abnormal movement or gait and can impair normal functional movement.</p>
