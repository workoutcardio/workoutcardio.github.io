<p>Works like a beta blocker to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. When you start your exercise, your muscles will start to work harder and demand more oxygen. If your heart rate remains above 100 beats per minutes six minutes after you stop exercising, you probably need to incorporate more aerobic exercise to increase your fitness level and overall health. Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles.</p>

<p>Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart's arteries to dilate more readily. The second heart may exhaust, whereas the healthy heart becomes stronger with a lower resting heart rate. When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress.

<p>Exercise greatly lowers the likelihood of individuals contracting forms of heart disease across the board. It also helps your sympathetic nervous system (which controls your heart rate and blood pressure) to be less reactive. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases. More oxygen is also going to the muscles.
