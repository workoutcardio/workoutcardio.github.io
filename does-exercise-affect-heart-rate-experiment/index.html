As a group, you must consider the following, and write down your ideas. As a group, develop a plan to answer the experimental questions, make sure you address all of the questions. Your brain counters with an increase in heart rate, but if dehydration continues, heart rate will continually. The hypothesis is if you test people who do high intensity cardiovascular exercise and those who do not exercise, then the people who do high intensity exercise will have a lower heart rate because their heart is more efficient.

<p>Lay down for one minute, take your heart rate and write down the number of beats per minute. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. The aim of this experiment was to find out whether the breathing rate and heart rate are affected by exercise. The hypothesis is if you test people who do high intensity cardiovascular exercise and those who do not exercise, then the people who do high intensity exercise will have a lower heart rate because their heart is more efficient.

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit. Although being overweight can affect the rate in which the heart rate goes back to the resting heart rate. The hypothesis is if you test people who do high intensity cardiovascular exercise and those who do not exercise, then the people who do high intensity exercise will have a lower heart rate because their heart is more efficient.
