Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
You probably know it as “cardio.”. Among the main characteristics of aerobic capacity we can find: Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received. By definition, aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.”.
