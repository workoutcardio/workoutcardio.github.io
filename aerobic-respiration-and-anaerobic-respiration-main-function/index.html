<p>This respiration is an important feature of life. It is considered another essential process of aerobic respiration. The energy of atp is used to power the cell’s life functions. The first step, like aerobic respiration, is glycolysis, that produces atp from the reactant glucose. Overview of the major steps of Cellular Respiration! Glycolysis, Krebs.</p>
