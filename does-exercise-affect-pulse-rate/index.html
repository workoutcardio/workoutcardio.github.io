How exercise affects our bodies (heart rate and short term memory From tes.com
Does exercising and running affect the pulse and why? Ensuring that any individuals with identified health issues do not take part, and ensuring that the activity does not become competitive (and hence boisterous) should reduce the risk of the activity causing damage. Now, compare your heart rate during exercise to your maximal heart rate. A low or moderate amount of physical activity doesn’t usually change the resting pulse much.
