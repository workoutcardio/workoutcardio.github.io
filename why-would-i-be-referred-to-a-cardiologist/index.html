There are many risk factors and potential causes of heart disease, including high blood pressure (hypertension), smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, inactivity and family history. Smoking lowers the flow of oxygen to the heart and increases blood pressure, heart rate, and blood clotting as well as damages the cells lining the arteries.
