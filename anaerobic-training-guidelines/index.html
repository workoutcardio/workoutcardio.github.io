Anaerobic Glycolytic Training Guidelines Interval From slideshare.net
There are two anaerobic power systems available to the body: Aerobic plus anaerobic training produces greater lipid metabolism without significant changes to glucose9 levels,. This type of exercise benefits. This is because the aerobic system, which burns fat for fuel, and is responsible for the body’s health, energy regulation, longevity, and endurance performance, develops over a relatively long term.
