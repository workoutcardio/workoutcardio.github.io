<p>However, anaerobic organisms use either fermentation or anaerobic cellular respiration to produce atp. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. 4.11 Anaerobic Processes Human Biology.</p>

<p>What does the term anaerobic mean in biology? A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. Oxygen is absent when this form of respiration takes place. Aerobic respiration is a continuous process and it happens all the time inside the cells of animals and plants.
