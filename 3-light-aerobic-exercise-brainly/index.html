Training heart rate = 123 x.70% = 86. During exercise the body burns fat and as a result the total body fat is reduced. That means that the heart rate is reduced in times of relaxation and during the exercise. Target heart rate = 86 &#43; 70 = 156.

As you land, touch your right fingertips to the floor, keeping your back flat, shoulders back, and core engaged. This phase often lasts between 15 and 50 minutes, ideally lasting between 20 and 40 minutes.
