<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. I have included the bloodwork of the cardiolipin tests. The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.

<p>Aps, anti cadiolipin igg antibody test is an autoimmune disorder which causes miscarriage as the body start treating the fetus as the harmful foreign object and try to eliminate it from the body. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.

<p>The cardiolipin antibodies blood test, iga, igg, and igm is used to help investigate inappropriate blood clot formation, to help determine the cause of recurrent miscarriage, or as part of an evaluation for antiphospholipid syndrome or sometimes other autoimmune diseases. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the bodyâs own cardiolipins. The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity. Cardiolipin Antibodies IgG, IgM, IgA.</p>
