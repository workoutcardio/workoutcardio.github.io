What&#39;s the BEST Cardio to Preserve Muscle??? YouTube From youtube.com

This has led many people to suggest completely abolishing cardio from the bodybuilder’s arsenal. There are those that say low intensity cardio performed for longer periods of time is better for fat loss, while others claim that short duration, high intensity cardio sessions will give the best results.
