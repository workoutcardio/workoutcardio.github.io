<meta name="description" content="Easy What Is Cardiolipin Antibody Igg And Igm For Man, The cardiolipin antibodies blood test, iga, igg, and igm is used to help investigate inappropriate blood clot formation, to help determine the cause of recurrent miscarriage, or as part of an evaluation for antiphospholipid syndrome or sometimes other autoimmune diseases. However, a higher concentration of antibodies may be a strong indication of autoimmune disease [ 5 ].
Antivimentin/cardiolipin complex antibodies in patients and healthy… From researchgate.net
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. They are also found in up to 20% of young stroke patients. Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria.

The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). Answers are given both in igg and igm antibodies. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated miscarriages.</p>

The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time.</p>

Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more. An cardiolipin igg test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood.
