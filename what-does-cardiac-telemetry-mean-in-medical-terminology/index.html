Only difference is that a small transmitting device is attached to the person which transmits to the receiver elsewhere. Given its specific features, heart telemetry and recording is appropriate for patients who: The science and technology of automatic measurement and transmission of data by wire, radio, or other means from remote sources, as from space vehicles, to receiving stations for recording and analysis. In a general sense, telemetry works through sensors at the remote source which measures physical (such as precipitation, pressure or temperature) or electrical (such as current or voltage) data.
