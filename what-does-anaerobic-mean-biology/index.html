Anaerobic definition is biology of this breakdown of glucose, amino acids, carbohydrates and fats. Anaerobes, on the other hand, cannot grow in. Anaerobic respiration, respiration in the absence of oxygen, using some other. Anaerobic respiration is a relatively fast re action and produces 2 atp, which is far fewer than aerobic respiration.
