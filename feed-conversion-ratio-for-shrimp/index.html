<p>A feed conversion ratio of cattle is 12.5. What is feed conversion ratio (fcr)? Usually, in ponds used for research, for a catfish that has been raised from fingerlings to the size of 1.5 or 1 pounds, the fcr is for about 1.8 or lower.

Provide the students with the formula for feed conversion, or feed to gain, ratio: One of used benchmarks in a level of effectiveness and efficiency of feeding programs is the food conversion ratio (fcr), which is a ratio between cumulative amount of feed that has been given to the shrimp compared with produced biomass at a certain time.for example: Typical fcrs for animals raised using commercial feeds and intensive production methods (i.e.</p>
