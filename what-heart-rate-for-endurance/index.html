<p>Rowing is a less intensive exercise beneficial for beginners while aiding in improved heart rate and lung function. Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope. Some studies suggest a correlation between endurance training and atrial fibrillation (afib), a potentially dangerous heart condition. In the endurance sports, the use of hrv has been studied in 2 general settings—the short term and the longer term.</p>
