<p>Step aerobics is a lesson using special equipment in the form of a step, which you need to climb and descend with various types of steps and jumps. That means that itâs a good cardiovascular exercise and helps to benefit your health in general. You can also use no risers (making the step only 4â high) or use no step at all, and do all the movements on the floor. In general, the more complex the choreography and the higher your step, the tougher the workout.</p>
