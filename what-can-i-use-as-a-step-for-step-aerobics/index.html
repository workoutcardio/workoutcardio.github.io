<p>Step aerobics is a lesson using special equipment in the form of a step, which you need to climb and descend with various types of steps and jumps. That means that it’s a good cardiovascular exercise and helps to benefit your health in general. You can also use no risers (making the step only 4” high) or use no step at all, and do all the movements on the floor. In general, the more complex the choreography and the higher your step, the tougher the workout.</p>
