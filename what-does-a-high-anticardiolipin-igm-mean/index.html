Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. Since igm are antibodies formed in response to a first time infection, high levels could mean a new infection. If it is very low, or other antibodies are also low (or not functioning), it may be a sign of immune deficiency that can lead to more infections. There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies:

The classic presentations include fetal death or thrombosis (arterial or venous thromboembolism), in the presence of persistently increased titers of antiphospholipid (apl) antibodi.

<p>Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an increased risk of excessive clotting or recurrent miscarriages. Cardiolipin antibody tests are usually reported as a positive or negative result. Some RE patients have additional potentiallypathogenic autoimmune ab's.</p>

<p>The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Slightly or moderately positive results are sometimes temporarily. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individualâs immune system attacks their red blood cells. You have elevated igm levels which could indicate various conditions like macroglobulinemia, mononucleosis, early viral hepatitis, a parasite infection, rheumatoid arthritis or nephritic syndrome. clinicalcellularimmunologysignificantlyhigher.</p>
