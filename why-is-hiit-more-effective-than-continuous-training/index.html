<p>A key consideration when comparing hiit with continuous exercise is whether the same amount of calories is burned. Hiit can reduce heart rate and blood. Hiit can promote a number of physiological benefits, such as increased mitochondrial density, improved stroke volume, improved oxidative capacity of muscle and enhanced aerobic efficiency, which was previously thought to occur only as a result of long, slow distance (lsd) training protocols. Well, in a 2015 study, researchers compared the afterburn of cardio, hiit, and weight training workouts.</p>
