The nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical cycle during which organic and inorganic nitrogen in different chemical forms will circle through the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine environments. What does nitrogen cycle mean? What does nitrogen cycle mean? Nitrogen cycle definition, the continuous sequence of events by which atmospheric nitrogen and nitrogenous compounds in the soil are converted, as by nitrification and nitrogen fixation, into substances that can be utilized by green plants, the substances returning to the air and soil as a result of the decay of the plants and denitrification.

<p>The atmosphere contains almost 78% of nitrogen present in an inert form (n2). It happens when certain types of bacteria take in nitrate and convert it back to nitrogen gas. The nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical process in which nitrogen, in various forms, is circulated from the atmosphere to the living organisms and later back to the atmosphere.

The nitrogen cycle is the succession of biochemical processes and changes through which nitrogen is used by living bodies and then released at the time of death and decomposition of the bodies, then returned to its initial oxidised state. Denitrification is the final step in the nitrogen cycle. BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES Local.brookings.k12.sd.us.</p>

<p>Plants convert this nitrogen into plant proteins. Nitrogen fixing occurs naturally in four ways. Nitrogen moves through the air, soil and living organisms ( plants, animals and bacteria ) in a process called the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen cycle definition, the continuous sequence of events by which atmospheric nitrogen and nitrogenous compounds in the soil are converted, as by nitrification and nitrogen fixation, into substances that can be utilized by green plants, the substances returning to the air and soil as a result of the decay of the plants and denitrification.

<p>[noun] a continuous series of natural processes by which nitrogen passes successively from air to soil to organisms and back to air or soil involving principally nitrogen fixation, nitrification, decay, and denitrification. Nitrogen is a common limiting nutrient in nature, and agriculture. Through a series of microbial transformations, however, nitrogen is made. Very simply when scientists talk about cycles they are talking about sequences of events that repeat themselves. Which Of The Following Is True About Ecosystems KAMPION.</p>

<h3 id="nitrogen-cycle-used-as-a-noun-is-very-rare">Nitrogen Cycle Used As A Noun Is Very Rare.</h3><p>Although 78 percent by volume of the atmosphere is nitrogen gas, this abundant reservoir exists in a form unusable by most organisms. The cyclic process by which nitrogen as in the atmosphere is transmitted from air to soil, from soil to plants, from plants to animals, and finally from organisms to the atmosphere and maintains the balance of nitrogen in the environment is called the nitrogen cycle (3). The atmosphere contains almost 78% of nitrogen present in an inert form (n2). Nitrogen cycle is important because nitrogen is an important building block in all living organisms.</p>
