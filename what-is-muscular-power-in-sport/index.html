Muscular Strength In Sports And Why Every Athlete Needs It From thesportsedu.com
In order to obtain greater muscular power, exercises should be performed with explosive execution and speed. We can use the first repetition on the 5 seconds power test to compute the time of the concentric phase. Muscular strength is distinct from muscular endurance (the ability to produce and sustain muscle force over a certain period of time) and muscular power (the ability to produce a given amount of force quickly) Movement in the human body is a manifestation of force exerted primarily through muscle activity.

<p>Afterwards, we will use the time and the travelled distance to compute the power. Muscular strength is distinct from muscular endurance (the ability to produce and sustain muscle force over a certain period of time) and muscular power (the ability to produce a given amount of force quickly) While strength in sports is the maximum force an athlete can apply to a given load, power is proportional to the speed at which the force is applied. Certain sports, such as weightlifting, boxing and weight throwing, it is one of the most important physical attributes.</p>
