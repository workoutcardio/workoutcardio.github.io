Name convert meaning of letter o. Conversion and its related terms yield and selectivity are important terms in chemical reaction engineering.they are described as ratios of how much of a reactant has reacted (x — conversion, normally between zero and one), how much of a desired product was formed (y — yield, normally also between zero and one) and how much desired product was formed in ratio. This is a list of all biology terms we have at this moment. V is the voltage, measured in volts (v).
