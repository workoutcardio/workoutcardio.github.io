The more you exercise, the more effectively your heart pumps oxygen to. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. Your muscles are pushing your blood back to your heart at a faster rate, so your heart must increase its rate of pumping to match. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease.
