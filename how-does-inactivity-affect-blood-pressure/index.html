<p>Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death in many developed countries. The effect is to maintain a higher venous return to the heart and an elevated cardiac output, despite a reduction in blood volume due to increased capillary filtration pressure. This suggests that a protein intake level greater than normal could be required to achieve the same postprandial anabolic effect during muscle inactivity. Lack of activity can also cause a condition called orthostatic hypotension, or low blood pressure with changes in body position. Hold the Rains&hellip; May is Blood Pressure Awareness Month.
