After age 27, you start to lose about 1% of your muscle mass each. Physical activity that requires the body to go all out, during which the muscles rely heavily on production of energy without adequate oxygen supply. The oxygen is needed to breakdown glucose. The physical activity pyramid the physical activity pyramid classifies activities by type as associated benefits.

<p>Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; However, it noted that resistance training is important. When combined with healthy, balanced nutrition, it has several health benefits such as losing weight, building, maintaining muscle, and enhancing your cardiovascular endurance. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise.</p>

Aerobic exercise is when the intensity of physical activity is sufficient enough to lead to a significant increase in the uptake of oxygen in muscles.
