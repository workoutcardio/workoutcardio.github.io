Introduction to the energy systems From slideshare.net
After age 27, you start to lose about 1% of your muscle mass each. Physical activity that requires the body to go all out, during which the muscles rely heavily on production of energy without adequate oxygen supply. The oxygen is needed to breakdown glucose. The physical activity pyramid the physical activity pyramid classifies activities by type as associated benefits.

<p>Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; However, it noted that resistance training is important. When combined with healthy, balanced nutrition, it has several health benefits such as losing weight, building, maintaining muscle, and enhancing your cardiovascular endurance. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise.</p>

Anaerobic literally means âwithout air,â so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. When combined with healthy, balanced nutrition, it has several health benefits such as losing weight, building, maintaining muscle, and enhancing your cardiovascular endurance.

<p>In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Creatine is a naturally occurring substance that regenerates atp during maximum anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; Short intervals of exercise at maximum intensity followed by short periods of.

<p>After age 27, you start to lose about 1% of your muscle mass each. However, the opposite applies to anaerobic exercises. Creatine supplementation has been shown to be effective in improving performance in simple anaerobic events of short duration. The crucial point is that the body burns glucose and release energy in a very short period of time while the bodyâs oxygen demands exceed the oxygen supply.

<p>This is referring to whether or not your body uses oxygen to provide energy for your workout. After age 27, you start to lose about 1% of your muscle mass each. Aerobic exercise is when the intensity of physical activity is sufficient enough to lead to a significant increase in the uptake of oxygen in muscles. A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training.
