Heart Rate Experiment Teaching Resources From tes.com
Previous lessons may have already looked at observing the effects of exercise on the body, but this experiment asks students to find out what effect exercise has on the heart rate. Whether people like the salted ice cream better or not is the dependent variable, or my result. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. It is obvious that the breathing rate is directly proportional to heart rate and both should amalgamate during exercise to prevent illness (haldane, 2013).
