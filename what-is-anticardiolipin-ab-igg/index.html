<p>Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).
