<p>Ideally, you'd want 4+ training days to accommodate the extra work, but you could probably squeeze in chest work twice a week on. If you're able to dedicate to it, you can barbell flat bench three times a week and vary your accessorial chest exercises to activate your chest differently each time. If you try and exercise your chest 3 times a week, go ahead and see the results. Instead of merely practicing legs and chest once a week, you should ideally be doing it twice a week, according to the experts.</p>
