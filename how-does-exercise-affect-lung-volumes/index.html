The lungs bring oxygen into the body, to provide energy, and remove carbon dioxide, the waste product created when you produce energy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether accurate hw measures c. This increases the amount of the lung that is perfused which decreases physiologic dead space.these changes increase oxygen delivery to exercising tissues. That amount of air is called the tidal volume, or the amount of air you can take in during inspiration.

<p>The respiratory volume goes up immediately, and regular exercise leads to an increase in overall efficiency of your. In general, regular exercise has no significant effect on pulmonary function measures such as total lung capacity (tlc), which is the volume of air in the lungs after taking the largest breath possible, and forced vital capacity (fvc), which is the amount of air able to be blown out after taking the largest breath possible (fvc). The lungs have to strive harder to obtain optimum oxygen at high elevation, a great way to increase your lung capacity. Lung volume is affected by your height, weight and the altitude at which you live.</p>
