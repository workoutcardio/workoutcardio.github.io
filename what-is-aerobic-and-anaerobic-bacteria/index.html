Grow aerobically or anaerobically in the presence or absence of oxygen. The other group is the anaerobes which are further separated into two classes. Aerobic bacteria will gather on top to inhale most of the oxygen in order to survive, whereas anaerobic bacteria will rather collect on the bottom to avoid the oxygen. You are probably aware of aerobic exercise (aka cardio) as an exercise that uses respiratory oxygen to generate the energy you need for your working muscles.

<p>Aerobic bacteria are present in the water, soil and on the different surfaces. In many cases, anaerobic bacteria are found. Anaerobic bacteria is another type of bacteria that is just the opposite of aerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria inhales oxygen to remain alive. What are some examples of aerobic bacteria? Quora.</p>

<p>Bacteria can be divided into two categories; Anaerobic bacteria produce less energy. When cellular respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration and when it occurs in the absence of oxygen it is called anaerobic respiration. In contrast, an aerobic organism is an organism that requires an oxygenated environment. Rightwings Aerobic Vs Anaerobic Bacteria.</p>

<p>Aerobic bacteria are present in the water, soil and on the different surfaces. Aerobic bacteria able produce more energy. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids o2. This can be attributed to the fact that aerobic species have the ability to detoxify oxygen.

<p>As we mentioned earlier, the most prominent point of difference between these two, is the fact that aerobic bacteria require oxygen to survive, while anaerobic bacteria donât. They can produce sulfides, nitrates, methane, highly volatile fatty acids, and acetates after reacting with their final electron acceptors. This can be attributed to the fact that aerobic species have the ability to detoxify oxygen.

<p>Bacteria can be classified by their need and tolerance for oxygen: Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to function. Aerobic bacteria uses oxygen to oxidizes ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate. This is the nitrogen cycle, or nitrification process, that most fishkeepers should be somewhat familiar with.

A facultative anaerobe is an organism that makes atp by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation or anaerobic respiration if oxygen is absent.

<p>An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require molecular oxygen for growth. Aerobic respiration can be broken down. Aerobic bacteria uses oxygen to oxidizes ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate. Aerobic bacteria will gather on top to inhale most of the oxygen in order to survive, whereas anaerobic bacteria will rather collect on the bottom to avoid the oxygen.
