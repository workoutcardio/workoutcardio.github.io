How does this mean arterial pressure calculator work? An arterial catheter is used to monitor and obtain hemodynamic readings for evaluation of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean) for cardiovascular monitoring of acutely ill children. The mean arterial pressure (map) is one of the first variables that is monitored in these patients, and manipulation with vasopressor agents is relatively easy. To calculate your map, two values are required.
