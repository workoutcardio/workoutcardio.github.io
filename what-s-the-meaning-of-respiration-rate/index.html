What is a normal heart rate? YouTube From youtube.com
The process in living organisms of taking in oxygen from the surroundings and giving out. Respiratory rate is the rate at which a full breathing cycle occurs, both inhalation and exhalation. The number of breaths per minute or, more formally, the number of movements indicative of inspiration and expiration per unit time. Respiration rate is an important indicator of a patient&#39;s health.

<p>In practice, the respiratory rate is usually determined by counting the number of times the chest rises or falls per minute. When checking respiration, it is important to also note whether a person has any difficulty breathing. The rate is usually measured when a person is at rest and simply involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many times the chest rises.

<p>Respiratory rate is the rate at which a full breathing cycle occurs, both inhalation and exhalation. And for adults over 80, the normal respiration range is about 10 to 30 breaths per minute. Age exerts only about 4% of the causal influence on respiration rate. The respiration rate is a parameter which is used in ecological and agronomical modeling.in theoretical production ecology and aquaculture, it typically refers to respiration per unit of time (usually loss of biomass by respiration per unit of weight), also referred to as relative respiration rate.in theoretical production ecology, biomass is expressed as dry weight, in aquaculture as.
