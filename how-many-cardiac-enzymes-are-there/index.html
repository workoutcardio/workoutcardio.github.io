<p>Definition cardiac biomarkers are protein molecules released into the bloodstream from damaged heart. Cardiac enzymes which are otherwise called cardiac biomarkers include myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase. This test might be done if there is an abnormality on a heart tracing (electrocardiogram or ecg) that suggests heart attack or heart muscle damage.

<p>This can include speeding up or slowing down what the body does inherently in order to actually get the desired effect.3. Cardiac enzyme blood test is usually carried out by doctors in 2 situations: This test might be done if there is an abnormality on a heart tracing (electrocardiogram or ecg) that suggests heart attack or heart muscle damage. Both are equally sensitive, and usually only either one is measured. What Are Restriction Enzymes? Enzymes, Blog, Biology.</p>
