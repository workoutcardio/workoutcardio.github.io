During exercise, the diastolic blood pressure stays about the same or falls slightly.this is because exercise dilates or expands blood vessels, improves blood flow and decreases the resistance to blood flow within the arteries. The lungs respond by “recruiting” an increased number of smaller vessels (or arterioles) in order to accommodate this increase in blood flow and maintain a stable pulmonary arterial pressure and a stable if not decreased pulmonary vascular resistance.
