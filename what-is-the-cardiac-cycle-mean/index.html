<p>Atrial depolarization (and contraction) is represented by the p wave. Systole and diastole affect each other in an intimate manner to accomplish this goal. In the diastole phase, heart ventricles relax and the heart fills with blood. As the heart beats, it circulates blood through pulmonary and systemic circuits of the body.

<p>It is a period of relaxation of the heart chamber when refilling of the heart occurs. The period of contraction of the heart chamber and blood is pumped out of the heart. The heartâs primary function is to circulate blood throughout the body in a cycle.every day, the human heart beats around 100,000 times. Atrial depolarization (and contraction) is represented by the p wave. The Cardiac Cycle And Cardiac Output The Student Physiologist.</p>

<p>Frequently asked questions (faqs) on cardiac cycle, heart rate &amp; blood pressure. There are two phases of the cardiac cycle: During systole heart contracts and pumps blood through arteries. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Cardiac cycle.</p>

<p>The period of contraction of the heart chamber and blood is pumped out of the heart. It consists of two periods: The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle. Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart.

<p>During systole heart contracts and pumps blood through arteries. Heart, cardiac cycle the muscular contractions that squeeze blood through the chambers of the heart and around the blood circulatory system. For example, if the heart rate is 60 per minute, the cardiac cycle duration will be 1 sec. The cardiac cycle is repeated after every 0.8 seconds and thereby pumps about 5 litres of blood in a single heartbeat. Cardiac cycle.</p>
