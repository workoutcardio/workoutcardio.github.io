<p>Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; When the body is resting, the body is quickly trying to get oxygen into the muscles to nourish, repair and clear the waste products in the muscles. During heavy exercise, the total work exceeds the capacity for aerobic work, which is limited by oxygen transport (see later). Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs.</p>

<p>When the body is resting, the body is quickly trying to get oxygen into the muscles to nourish, repair and clear the waste products in the muscles. However, it noted that resistance training is important. Anaerobic exercise means you are working at such high intensity that your cardiovascular system can't deliver oxygen to your muscles fast enough (anaerobic means without oxygen). Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure.
