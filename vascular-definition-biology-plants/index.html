<p>What is the purpose of the xylem in a vascular plant? Vascular plants are defined by having tissue that can transport water, glucose, sucrose, and other molecules. The evolution of a vascular system was needed for trees to be able to grow without physically touching water by transporting and storing it within the organism. Vascular plants encompass several divisions of plants and are collectively known as tracheophytes. Vascular tissue.</p>

<p>Seedless vascular plants are a group of plants that have vascular systems and use spores to disperse their haploid gametophyte stage. The plant vascular system is a complicated network of conducting tissues that interconnects all organs and transports water, minerals, nutrients, organic compounds, and various signaling molecules throughout the plant body. Vascular plants are plants found on land that have lignified tissues for conducting water and minerals throughout the body of the plant. They contain xylem for water and mineral transport from roots to different parts of the plant and phloem for the transport of food from leaves to other parts of the plant.
