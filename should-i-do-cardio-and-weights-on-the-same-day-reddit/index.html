The correct answer is dependent on a number of factors such as the duration, impact and intensity of the cardio and how long you&#39;ve been exercising (eg: There are theories to say that we shouldn’t do cardio and resistance training (abs) on the same day because one will prevent maximum exertion on the other, but there are. If you&#39;re running a couple dozen miles a week, it might not be as good for building muscle as focusing more on the strength training. Running 2 miles per day is hardly going to ruin you.

<p>This is still true if you're also doing cardio. Cardio after weights is ideal because during the weight workout you are depleting muscle glycogen, meaning that during the cardio you will be burning mostly fat. Keep in mind, though, that doing a long cardio session before lifting weights may slightly delay your recovery time—a good reason to give yourself a few days off afterward. The “weights before cardio” group were slightly better off in every single test, including fat loss. This is my experience with Ketosis, and some of the things I did to see.</p>

<p>It depends on how it makes you feel. What changes is the amount of cardio or weight training i do in a given workout. If you’re looking to build strength and put on muscle mass, research suggests you are best to keep your weights separate from your cardio work. I've been seeing research that says cardio plus weights on the same day can fatigue you too much. Weights vs. Cardio Keep Them Separate or Combine? Scientific American.</p>

<p>Thirty obese young males were divided randomly into three groups that either performed weights before cardio, cardio before weights, or didn’t exercise at all. The correct answer is dependent on a number of factors such as the duration, impact and intensity of the cardio and how long you've been exercising (eg: My current routine is doing weights first, then doing a light 20 minute.

<p>So, in one pattern you can do both weights and cardio on same days. If you're running a couple dozen miles a week, it might not be as good for building muscle as focusing more on the strength training. Weights are going to help you stay lean in the long run by burning more calories with more muscle, but cardio is necessary for a healthy cardiovascular system. Personally, i do both every time i workout. Weight loss diet One woman shed over 5st using this plan what does.</p>

<p>Weights are going to help you stay lean in the long run by burning more calories with more muscle, but cardio is necessary for a healthy cardiovascular system. So combining two independently designed group workouts really isn't at all similar to physically demanding labor, which is typically light cardio combined with varying degrees of weight lifting, depending on the job. I like the results of weight lifting better, but cardio helps me with stress. What changes is the amount of cardio or weight training i do in a given workout.

<p>I would say focus on weights to build muscle which will burn more calories while at rest, but add in cardio because it’s healthy. The reason you do weights first is because you cardio can hinder your strength training. I've been seeing research that says cardio plus weights on the same day can fatigue you too much.

<p>There are theories to say that we shouldn’t do cardio and resistance training (abs) on the same day because one will prevent maximum exertion on the other, but there are. I am 29, 5'5 and currently weigh 164. My current routine is doing weights first, then doing a light 20 minute. This is true whether you do the cardio workout in the same workout, or if you simply do cardio less than six hours before your weight training.
