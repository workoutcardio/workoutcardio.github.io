<p>Dynamic stretching, as opposed to static stretching, whose function is to relax your muscles, this type of stretching activates your muscles and connective tissues in the same way that you perform them in your workout and the core together, mimicking many of the same movements we do in cardiovascular and resistance training. The key to flexibility is understanding the right type of stretching and strengthening movements to improve range of motion. This type of stretch was the bouncing stretch which you perform the exact stretches as the static stretches but you bounce numerous times. Research has shown that individual joints as well as the entire body, work optimally when all 3 types of flexibility are achieved equally.</p>
