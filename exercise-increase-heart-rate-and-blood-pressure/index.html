How can the heart increase cardiac output? Socratic From socratic.org
During exercise, your heart pumps more blood out to your body per minute, while the blood vessels within the muscles you are using expand. Above that would be high intensity. These two countering effects cause a rise in your blood pressure. It also helps you manage your cholesterol and weight loss.
