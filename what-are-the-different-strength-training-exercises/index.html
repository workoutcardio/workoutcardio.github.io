7 Essential Strength Training Exercises for Soldiers Visual.ly From visual.ly
Strength training exercises work your muscles by applying a resistance against which the muscles need to exert a force. To improve your agile strength, calabrese suggests doing exercises that require you to quickly move side to side or forward and back like skaters, shuffles, and shuttle runs. A plank is a good standard exercise to include in any workout routine. The aim is to use an appropriate weight or resistant force that will work the target muscles to fatigue, over 8 to 12 repetitions of an exercise.
