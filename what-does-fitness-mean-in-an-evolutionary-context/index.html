If the number of offspring organisms of a specific genotype or phenotype leaving in the following generation is greater than the number of offspring organisms from the previous generation, it is said to be high. What is the meaning of fitness and adaptation in an evolutionary context? Its fitness, its ability to survive and replicate, in frequency in a population over many generations. Why is this a useful term for biologists studying evolutionary patterns and processes?

<p>Data with how strongly correlated the measure is to the true evolutionary fitness of the organisms under study. (2 days ago) to an evolutionary biologist, fitness simply means reproductive success and reflects how well an organism is adapted to its environment. What does “fitness” mean when speaking in terms of evolution? A measure of average reproductive success.</p>

A measure of average reproductive success. Figure S5 Change in fitness of evolutionary antennas for different.</p>
