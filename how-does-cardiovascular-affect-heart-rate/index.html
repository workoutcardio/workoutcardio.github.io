To get a rough idea of your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. The nicotine in cigarettes raises blood pressure, increases heart rate and constricts the arteries throughout the body. Calculate your target heart rate. This happens because the heart rate is too high for the heart to pump blood effectively.

<p>Hrv data can indicate the impact of fatigue due to prior exercise sessions, hydration levels, stress and even the degree of performance anxiety, nervousness or other external stressful influences. Over time, with chronic cardio training, our resting heart rate drops because each beat delivers a bigger burst of blood, and fewer beats are needed. However, this decrease in pace does not correspond to your effort or fatigue levels. Excess thyroid hormone increases the force of contraction of the heart muscle and increases the amount of oxygen demanded by the heart. Factors That Affect the Heart Rate Healthfully.</p>
