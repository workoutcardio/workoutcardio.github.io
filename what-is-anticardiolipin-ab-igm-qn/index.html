Extra components (click to add to search): Cardiolipin (anticardiolipin) antibodies are autoantibodies that can affect blood clotting. I had lots of clotting in my placenta and umbilical cord as well as a placental abruption so this testing was performed. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].

<p>Cardiolipin antibody tests help diagnose the cause of blood clots, recurrent miscarriages or antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). The two most commonly tested are igg and igm. Elevations of ca associated with increased risk have also been seen in idiopathic. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of âdefinite antiphospholipid syndromeâ is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart.

<p>Beta2 glycoprotein 1 is the protein in the body to which anticardiolipin antibodies bind, and it is also possible to measure antibodies to beta2. The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>The two most commonly tested are igg and igm. Elevations of ca associated with increased risk have also been seen in idiopathic. Cardiolipin (anticardiolipin) antibodies are autoantibodies that can affect blood clotting. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

<p>Antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) is an autoimmune disease and is a risk factor for a number of clinical manifestations; Persistently elevated levels of acl antibodies are associated with an increased risk of vascular thrombosis and obstetrical complications [3, 4]. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. A. Levels of IgA anti B2GP1 and IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies.</p>
