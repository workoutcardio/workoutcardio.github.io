Everything You Need to Know About Getting a Cardiovascular Stress Test From blissmedicines.com
During a cardiac stress test with exercise, you will be asked to walk on a treadmill or pedal on a stationary bicycle. A nuclear stress test uses a small amount of radioactive material (tracer) and an imaging machine to create pictures showing the blood flow to your heart. They can help identify blockages and other potential prob. The test measures blood flow while you are at rest and during activity, showing areas with poor blood flow or damage in your heart.
