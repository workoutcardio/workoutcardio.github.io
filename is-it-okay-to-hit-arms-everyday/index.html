The more frequently you train arms, the less you should do per day.

<p>Training your arms every day could be a viable strategy if they're a stubborn muscle group. If you train arms 6 days per week, you’ll do one exercise per muscle group per day, with only 2 sets per workout.

I generally understand that you shouldn't work your arms everyday, at most every other day, or 3 days a week, etc. Wrist fractures in children how are they best treated? Evidently.</p>
