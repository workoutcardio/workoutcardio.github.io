The anaerobic bacteria are first observed by the scientist van leeuwenhoek. Anaerobic growth is when anaerobic bacteria grow in the absence of oxygen by carrying out anaerobic metabolism to produce energy and nutrients that are needed by the bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are bacteria that do not live or grow when oxygen is present. The broad classification of bacteria as anaerobic, aerobic, or facultative is based on the types of reactions they employ to generate energy for growth and other activities.
