Solved Fitbit heart rate accuracy question Fitbit Community From community.fitbit.com
None of them is 100% accurate concerning heart rate, far from it. The results of the fitbit ecg app may not be accurate in people who take medication or substances that affect heart rate or blood flow. You should never change your medication based on any result of the fitbit ecg app without first speaking to your doctor. I actually had pretty accurate heart rate tracking up until now.

<p>Iâve been wondering the same, i have a versa 3 and during high intensity activity iâve noticed that heart rate readings are sporadic. But most of the time it is in the context of it being fairly inaccurate for heartrate and step counting. On the elliptical, for instance, it seems to cap my heart rate at no more than 111 and then start backing the rate down to the range of about 80bpm. I tested the sleep tracking, step counting and heart rate monitoring of the fitbit sense.<em>subscribe to my weekly newsletter(!)</em> on <span class="navi text-left"><a class="badge badge-dark" href="https://www.robterhorst.cominstagr">www.robterhorst.cominstagr</a></span>.
