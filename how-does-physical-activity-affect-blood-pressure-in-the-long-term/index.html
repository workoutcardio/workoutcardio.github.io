Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart&#39;s contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat. To keep your blood pressure healthy, you need to keep exercising on a regular basis. The present study analyzed the relationship between physical activity and blood pressure in 701 school children aged 12&amp;#x2013;16 years (girls = 338, boys = 363). We conclude that acute inflammation reduced fmd only in yas and reduced bp only in oas.
