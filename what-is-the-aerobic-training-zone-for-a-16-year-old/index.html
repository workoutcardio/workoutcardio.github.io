<p>In addition to the development of your aerobic capacity, there are a number of other critical endurance athlete benefits that come with zone 2 training: More blood through your heart and body at the same hr. This method calculates thr using the karvonen equation and allows you to enter both a measured mhr and a measured rhr. The purpose behind zone 2 training is to be able to sustain a pace just below your aerobic threshold for 30+ minutes. PPT Physical Fitness Assessment PowerPoint Presentation, free.</p>
<h3 id="the-values-are-expressed-as-a-percentage-of-maximum">The Values Are Expressed As A Percentage Of Maximum.</h3><p>Aerobic zone 2 training is like raising the water level so a boat is higher up, whereas anaerobic training is like using a crane to lift the boat up instead.

The karvonen formula is a more accurate method for finding the heart rate training zones. Anaerobic means without oxygen, so don't be surprised if you are unable to speak except for short words at a time in this zone. The anaerobic zone is 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate.</p>
