As its name may suggest, aerobic endurance is built by engaging in cardiovascular, or aerobic, exercise. First, let us clarify what strength endurance training is.schmidtbleicher (1989) defines strength endurance as the ability of the neuromuscular system to produce as large a pulse sum as possible over a defined period (maximum 2 minutes at maximum load) against higher loads (more than 30% of the maximum force) and thereby to keep the reduction of the produced. We can define muscular endurance as the ability of a muscle, or a group of muscles, to repeatedly exert a force (contract) for an extended period.</p>
