What Is Anaerobic Metabolism slidedocnow From slidedocnow.blogspot.com
The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Both types of exercises are important for a person&#39;s health. Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen (o 2 ), one occurs. This process is faster but it also produces less atp.
