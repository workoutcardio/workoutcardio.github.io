<p>The increased heart rate during exercise is due to the muscles needing more oxygen to produce energy. The fall in heart rate immediately after exercise is considered to be a function of the reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

<p>Your anaerobic zone is somewhere between 80 percent and 90 percent of your mhr. The heart responds to the increased demand by pumping more blood through the body—this increased flow of blood results in an increased heart. This increased demand for oxygen is delivered by our circulatory system, which includes the heart. When your heart rate increases from a resting state, the muscle is exercising at a more intense rate than before. Why Does Pulse Rate Increase After Exercise ExerciseWalls.</p>
