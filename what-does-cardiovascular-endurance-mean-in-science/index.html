The 5 Components of Fitness Which Improves Cardiovascular Endurance From fitnesss.net
Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to working muscles and tissues, as well as the ability of those muscles and tissues to utilize that oxygen. Cv training is described as an activity that uses large muscle groups continuously for a long time. Distance swimming is also a good cardiovascular endurance exercise. Aerobic exercise is more useful for gaining cardiovascular endurance because it helps sustain more output for a longer period.
