Measure your resting heart rate (hr) find your radial pulse, located between your radius bone on the thumb side of your forearm and the tendon in the middle of your wrist. Count each pulse you feel for 15 seconds and then multiply that by 4 to get your hr per minute. The following sections review the strength of the evidence for a relationship between health outcomes and the four categories of fitness tests for cardiorespiratory endurance (distance/timed run, shuttle run, treadmill, and cycle ergometer). In the ergo test, the athlete sits in an indoor machine known as an ergometer and is timed as.
