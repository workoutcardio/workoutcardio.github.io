Is Running on a Treadmill Bad for Your Knees? From fitgenic.com
Many people do argue running on a treadmill is easier than running outside as the belt is flat and the motor pulls your forward rather than having to propel you forwards. Running outside is harder on the body than running on a treadmill. If they can hear the sound of your heels hitting the floor, the noise of a treadmill will most likely be very loud. Generally, a treadmill is safer for your legs than running outdoors, though you&#39;ll get a less challenging workout if you don&#39;t try different.
