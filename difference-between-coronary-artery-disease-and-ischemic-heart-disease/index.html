<p>Acute coronary syndrome is a term that includes heart attack and unstable angina. The coronary artery is blocked by the clot long enough to cause irreversible damage. It refers to heart problems caused by narrowed coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The association of coronary artery disease with heart valve disease is frequently encountered and it can be expected that this association will become more common because of the evolution in the epidemiology of valvar diseases.
