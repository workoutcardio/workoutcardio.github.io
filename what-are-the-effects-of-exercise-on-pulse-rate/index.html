The Effects of Alcohol and Exercise on Heart rate. The Phase × Drink From researchgate.net
This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. Count the number of beats for 15 seconds. This experiment was geared towards determining the pulse rate, heart rate, blood pressure level and the breathing rate of a student, during and after strenuous exercise activities. Exercise causes an increase in pulse rate (heart rate).

<p>Whilst doing exercise there is an increase in respiration, this means that the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood will also increase as the oxygen is used up. F tell the students that they are going to do some exercise. When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Exercise and Breathing.</p>
