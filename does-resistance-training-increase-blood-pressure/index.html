<p>Blood pressure was directly recorded by means of a capacitance transducer connected to a catheter in the brachial artery. It’s true that systolic blood pressure rises transiently when you do any type of resistance training, but this temporary increase in blood pressure isn’t dangerous if you’re using proper form. There is limited evidence for comparison of aerobic training and resistance training in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure. The practice of resistance exercises can reverse this picture, helping to maintain the muscular mass and improving muscular strength and resistance. Why doesn’t blood pressure increase during exercise? Quora.</p>
