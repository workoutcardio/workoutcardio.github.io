<p>A good time to start working out? If you haven’t been physically active for a while or you’re trying a new workout, you may feel some muscle soreness, especially the day or two after your workout. Working out in the morning may help to control appetite and lead to more weight loss more than working out at other times of day. In fact, if you feel sore the next day, you know that you put in some hard work.</p>
