Phloem and xylem in a plant&#39;s vascular system explained Britannica From britannica.com
The larger an organism is, the more complex and efficient the nutrient and water transport systems need to be. The epidermis, the ground tissue, and the vascular tissue. The vascular system of a plant is the tissue and series of tubes and veins that move nutrients collected by the roots to the stem and leaves. The two essential functions performed by the vascular system, namely the delivery of resources (water, essential mineral nutrients, sugars and amino acids) to the various plant organs and provision of mechanical support are next discussed.

<p>The main plant body is the haploid gametophyte. Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. They contain complex vascular tissues, i.e. This video will go through the vascular tissues of plants (this has been explored in previous posts as well).</p>

<p>The elements of xylem and phloem have already been discussed in the. The xylem tissue in vascular plants is rigid and can be fossilized. The main plant body is the haploid gametophyte. Plants must find a way to move energy and water around in order to survive, and the most sophisticated way plants do this on earth is by using specialty cells to form a “vascular system”.
