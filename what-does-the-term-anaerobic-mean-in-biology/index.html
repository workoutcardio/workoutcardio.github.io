It may also relate to an anaerobe that is capable of occurring or thriving in the absence of air or free oxygen. A form of respiration in which molecular oxygen is not consumed, for example, nitrate respiration, sulfate respiration. This term appears only rarely outside of the context of biology.

<p>Glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvic acid (pyruvate) in the general cell cytoplasm. The main difference between anaerobic and aerobic exercise is how intense the activity is, aerobic has a lower intensity while anaerobic has a higher intensity. Processes which are anaerobic tend to be found in stationary waters, and inside our muscles for example. Some microorganisms are capable of anaerobic cellular respiration, which means they can survive in very harsh conditions.</p>
