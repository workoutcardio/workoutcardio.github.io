This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia. In the case of the heart and lungs, the results can be deadly.

<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. Therefore, some individuals with syphilis will display positive cardiolipin antibody results. Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently requested to help find the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be requested with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings.

<p>This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. This phospholipid plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetic processes including the production of atp. The cardiolipin test is also just a marker and does not specifically point to either rheumatoid or lupus, they both must be interpreted with your symptoms.

<p>The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. The cardiolipin antibodies blood test, iga, igg, and igm is used to help investigate inappropriate blood clot formation, to help determine the cause of recurrent miscarriage, or as part of an evaluation for antiphospholipid syndrome or sometimes other autoimmune diseases. When you see excessive blood clot, then the symptoms and signs may differ based on the location of the clot. However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then iga cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered. ANTI CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY.</p>
