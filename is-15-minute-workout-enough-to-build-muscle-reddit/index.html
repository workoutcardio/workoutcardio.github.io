5 MINUTE ARM WORKOUT HOME of GYM ONLINE FITNESS AND WORKOUT PLATFORM From homeofgym.com
Stand in a squat position, lower in a squat, and add a bicep curl as you squat (about 12 reps). I am skinny and i don’t really need to become huge, i just want to grow some muscle and get more defined. Tabata is a form of interval training where you do 20 sec work with 10 sec rest. I dont warm up though, i go straight in.
