<p>Periodic crf assessment can have an important preventive function. The best method to measure cardiorespiratory fitness is by measuring vo2max, which is a calculation of how efficiently your body can transport and uitlize oxygen. Traditionally used weight‐proportional measures are potentially confounded by body adiposity that hampers their interpretation and applicability in the clinical assessment of cardiorespiratory. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy production needed during physical activity.
