<p>Any activity that increases the heart rate, in turn pumping oxygen around the body. Anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen, so it cannot produce atp.

<p>Your cardiorespiratory system consists of your heart, blood vessels and lungs. Aerobic respiration is more efficient because it uses oxygen to break down glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids and is the primary method the body produces adenosine triphosphate (atp), which provides energy to the muscles. Cardiovascular performance is reflected in the arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (mean arterial blood flow), which in turn are dependent on four factors: Aerobic efficiency theory and practice. Characterization of the Obese Phenotype of Heart Failure With Preserved.</p>

<p>Aerobic capacity is typically measured by a lab test such as the. Preload, afterload, ventricular contractility, and heart rate.

<p>Preload, which refers to the degree to which sarcomeres are stretched just before systole, is defined as the end. The intensity of the exercise. Thus aerobic exercise is defined as exercise that promotes a greater oxygen intake, and cardio exercise is exercise that promotes a greater heart rate.
