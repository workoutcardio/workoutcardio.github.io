Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. The test measures igg and igm levels.

Keep reading to learn more about high and low igm levels and the factors that may affect them. Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings suggest that the patient.

<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). If it is very low, or other antibodies are also low (or not functioning), it may be a sign of immune deficiency that can lead to more infections.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individualâs immune system attacks their red blood cells.
