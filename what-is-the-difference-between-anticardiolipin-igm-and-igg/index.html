However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then iga cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered. However, a higher concentration of antibodies may be a strong indication of autoimmune disease [ 5 ]. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. Now that antibody testing is increasing across the country, it is important for us to recognize the differences between the antibodies that are.

<p>The molecular weight of igm is 900kda and that of igg is 150kda. The immunoglobulin m (igm) antibody is the largest among the five major types of immunoglobulins and is the first antibody that is created by the body to fight infections. Igm is produced by the body in response to a foreign invader, such as a virus or bacteria, while igg is produced by the body in response to a different type of antigen.

<p>In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. Igm is produced by the body in response to a foreign invader, such as a virus or bacteria, while igg is produced by the body in response to a different type of antigen. The two most commonly tested are igg and igm. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps.

Igm account for only 10% of the total volume of the serum and igg occupies 75% of the total volume of the serum. The antibody igm function is to perform cytosolic reaction and to do agglutinations, while the antibody igg functions to activate the complement system.
