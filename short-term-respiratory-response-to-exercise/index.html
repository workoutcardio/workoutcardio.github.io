Here are the 3 most important effects of training on the respiratory system. During exercise, the gas exchange requirements of the lung increase due to an increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide production. The strength and endurance of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles improves. In addition, the respiratory system helps buffer the metabolic acids as they build up during intense exercise.

<p>During exercise, the gas exchange requirements of the lung increase due to an increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide production. The bodyâs energy stores are slowly depleted. The air that is exhaled during exercise is humidified and is at body temperature. Breathing after exercise becomes lighter and slower due to an adaptation of the respiratory system and the breathing center to higher co2 levels.
