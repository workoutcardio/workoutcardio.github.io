The concept of “fat burning” exercise has been taken way out of context from dr. Slow cardio helps you burn a higher percentage of fat, but it does not help you burn more fat overall.for instance, if you do a low intensity cardio for 30 minutes, you may get a higher percentage coming from fat, but you have done a low intensity, so you have not burned that many calories. Research also suggests hiit will result in a greater reduction of body fat, compared to traditional exercise.
