To get a rough idea of your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. With a slower heart rate, the heart&#39;s left ventricle has more time to fill with blood and more time to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body and heart muscle. At five minutes post workout you should be 120 bpm or less. But if you experience a drop in your heart rate while exercising, it could signify either a minor, temporary problem or a more serious underlying cardiovascular condition.
