A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).
