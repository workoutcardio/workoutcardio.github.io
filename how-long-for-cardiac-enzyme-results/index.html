Usually, this test measures the troponin level in the blood. Cardiac enzyme studies measure the levels of enzymes and proteins that are linked with injury of the heart muscle. “if a patient has cardiac enzymes tested soon after a heart attack starts, levels are often normal. Elevations of cardiac enzyme levels should be interpreted in the context of clinical and ecg findings [ 1].

<p>Tachycardia is one cause of troponin elevation in noncoronary diseases, and careful interpretation of the laboratory results is necessary. Low levels of these proteins and enzymes are normally found in your blood. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle.

<p>Low levels of these proteins and enzymes are normally found in your blood. The use of laboratory markers has evolved and kept pace with the field of cardiology itself.

<p>Cardiac troponin levels are normally so low they cannot be detected with most blood tests, so when they are detected, it’s usually significant in showing that heart muscle damage due to a myocardial infarction has occurred. Cardiac troponins t and i are the preferred markers for myocardial injury as they have the highest sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [ 1].
