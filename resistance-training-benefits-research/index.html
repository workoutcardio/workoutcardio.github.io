So, before we start, let’s clarify…resistance training isn’t just for those interested in bulking like the gold’s gym logo (who—fun fact—was modeled after pro wrestler ric drasin, training partner to arnold schwarzenegger). Once the body adapts to a particular training stress (by getting stronger), a new stress must be introduced. Age is a primary risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including mobility disability, cardiovascular disease (cvd), type 2 diabetes (t2d), and cancer. The benefits of resistance training, including increased strength, and hypertrophy, are well known to aspiring trainees.

<p>Variable resistance training offers variable resistance throughout the entire range of motion (rom) during exercise, whereas, constant resistance is a more traditional training protocol that demands unvarying resistance on the muscles and joints during an exercise routine. Resistance training has been proposed as an effective and motivating method that is compatible with the nature of children's intermittent physical activity [4]. There is less pressure put on your joints.
