<p>As the intensity of your workout increases, your muscles need more fuel as they produce more waste. Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability to perform physical activities by engaging large muscle groups and the whole body at moderate to high intensities for extended periods. Regular physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, has been shown to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance means that you will increase your physical shape, and therefore be able to exercise for longer periods and at a higher intensity level.</p>
