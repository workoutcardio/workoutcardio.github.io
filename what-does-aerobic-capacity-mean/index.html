Know Your Aerobic Training Zones From frontrunnersports.com.au
Your individual aerobic fitness level determines your heart rate on the at so there isn’t one specific optimal threshold. Rugby star james o’connor is known to incorporate aerobic training, like trail running in the blue mountains, alongside the routine. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received.
