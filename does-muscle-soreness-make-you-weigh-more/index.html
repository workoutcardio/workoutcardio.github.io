Building muscle will help you in many ways not only in your appearance, it will make your body a fat burning machine, hgh levels will consistently be in production, and you will have more stamina and agility. The good thing is that more muscle means improved strength and energy, and a higher metabolism. If you&#39;ve been working out hard in hopes of losing weight, but instead weigh more and appear thinner it may be because you have replaced body fat with lean muscle. It’s not a good workout unless you’re sore the next day.

<p>One pound of fat takes up more room in the body than 1 lb. By jill corleone updated april 11, 2018. Whenever you start an exercise regime, your weight may increase due to muscle soreness.soreness is basically a result of breakdown of muscle tissue and occurs for a day or two after every workout. I arrived at this hypothesis because i thought that repairing muscle tissue required water, so you're body would store extra water to repair damaged tissue.</p>

<p>We often wear our doms as a badge of honor and believe that if we’re not sore, we’re not doing enough during out workouts. Sore muscles are injured muscles. More water would weigh you down. Now this doesn’t mean that muscle damage is required for muscle growth (research shows that muscle growth still occurs without muscle damage), but it may provide an additive or synergistic effect to the other mechanisms.and since studies show that muscle soreness is definitely an indication of whether muscle damage took place or not, one would assume that.
