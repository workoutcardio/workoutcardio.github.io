Differences between Interventional Cardiologist and Invasive, Non From medicalbillersandcoders.com
The difference is the individual is trained to run medical testing to locate arterial blockages. Interventional cardiologist s r those who r involved in doing interventions to correct the cardiac problem like angiogram angioplasty and valvuloplasty and so on noninvasive cardiologists do diagnose and treat cardiac problems without any interventional procedures, like ecg echo holter. However, this represents a wide range of procedures, most of which we would describe as minimally invasive.
