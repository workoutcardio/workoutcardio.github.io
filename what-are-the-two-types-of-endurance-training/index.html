Basic endurance is the main type of endurance training and is characterized by low intensity, high volume exercises. The endurance program effectively enhances the ability of the heart the reduction the risk of cardiovascular disease and pump oxygenated blood. Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance. Pin on Fitness.</p>
