What happens if we throw a watch with 5 Atm in a bucket of water? Quora From quora.com
10 bar, 10 atm, 100 meter (100m) water resistant is suitable for swimming and water sports. 5atm will withstand pressures equivalent to about 50 meters, or 164 ft under water. If a watch has an ip68 water resistance, this means that it is both dust tight, and can withstand being fully submersed into water over a meter deep. What does 5atm water resistant mean?
