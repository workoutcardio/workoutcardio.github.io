<p>Short, high intensity exercise can take many forms, but it has certain constants—the exercise will be purely anaerobic in its nature (usually activities or individual segments of a longer exercise of fewer than 90 seconds duration), and it will require the athlete to perform at between 75% and 85% of the maximum physical capability. This is due to an increase in the number and thickness of actin and myosin filaments, an increase in myofibrils and an increase in sarcoplasm (fluid within the muscle cell). Muscle size increases with hypertrophy training and to a lesser degree strength training. Costigan sa, eather n, plotnikoff rc, taaffe dr, lubans dr.
