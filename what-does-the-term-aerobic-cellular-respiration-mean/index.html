Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. Anaerobic means ‘without air’ and refers to the body producing energy without oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the aerobic catabolism of nutrients to carbon dioxide, water, and energy, and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration are two different processes that allow cells to convert energy from food into a form that they can use.

During cellular respiration, energy is produced (and stored as atp) by oxidizing carbon in various biomolecules such as. Cellular respiration is defined as the conversion of fuel into energy and nutrients within the mitochondria and cytosol of cells. What does aerobic respiration produce? Quora.</p>

Aerobic, or respiration in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. Aerobic cellular respiration uses oxygen and yields many more atp molecules than anaerobic cellular respiration, which does not use oxygen and yields only two atp molecules.</p>
