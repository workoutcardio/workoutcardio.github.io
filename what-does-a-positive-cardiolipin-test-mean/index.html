Cardiolipin exposure on the outer mitochondrial membrane modulates α From nature.com
An cardiolipin igm test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. Positive test result indicates that antibodies to cardiolipin are present in the body. For example, the presence of a speckled positive ana indicates the presence of these specific autoantibodies, ssa, ssb, rnp, smith, and ku antibodies. A negative result means no cardiolipin antibody was detected in the blood.

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The test for cardiolipin antibodies may also be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and/or has a positive result on an ana test, as the test may provide the health care practitioner with additional information to help establish a diagnosis.
