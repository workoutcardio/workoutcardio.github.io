The cardiac output increases rapidly initially and then gradually and eventually it will reach a plateau. Read this page to discover how the heart responds to different types and intensities of exercise. The chronic responses to exercise are directly correlated with the exercise stimulus, or the type of exercise that is performed. While exercising, we have an increase stimulation or excitation of the heart occurring so that we are able to supply blood to the skeletal muscles that are working.
