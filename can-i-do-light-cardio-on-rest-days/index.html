Many of the improvments may not directly affect the actual 3 second action of the lift, but they greatly impact the recovery and supply for any repeat efforts.

<p>By light active rest i’m referring to doing something of the sort of light cardio or to focus on training muscle groups that don’t get much workout during the week. Just make sure you are eating enough and don't push yourself to silly levels. Yea at least on your rest days i dont see why a little cardio would hurt. However, if you want to strip fat and keep your cardiovascular fitness up, it is recommended you do a light cardio session like a run or swim between weight sessions.
