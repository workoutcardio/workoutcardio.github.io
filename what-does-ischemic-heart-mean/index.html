Ischemic Heart Disease.ppt From slideshare.net
Heart disease that occurs as a result of inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, as in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. It also means local hypoxia in. Ischemic heart disease (ihd), also called coronary heart disease (chd) or coronary artery disease (cad), is defined as the state in which blood supply to the heart is decreased by the narrowing of heart (coronary) arteries whose supply the blood to the heart (cardiac) muscles4. In the context of the brain, microvascular ischemia disease is a term that refers to alterations that occur in the tiny blood vessels.
