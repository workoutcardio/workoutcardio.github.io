<p>In other words, respiration is the key way that a cell gets chemical energy to drive cellular activity. It can occur both in the presence and in the absence of oxygen. Respiration and breathing are two different types of processes that occur. All organisms require energy to carry out various activities.

<h3 id="oxygen-is-absent-when-this-form-of-respiration-takes-place">Oxygen Is Absent When This Form Of Respiration Takes Place.</h3><p>First, respiration may refer to external respiration or the process of gas exchange between the air and an organism's cells. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. Mainly applicable for bacteria, yeast.</p>
