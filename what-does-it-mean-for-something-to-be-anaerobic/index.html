Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. Examples are gut flora, skin flora, and bacterial disease. Some bacteria are aerobic and others are anaerobic. Anaerobic means living, active, occurring, or existing in the absence of free oxygen, as opposed to aerobic which means living, active, or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. anaerobic may also refer to:
