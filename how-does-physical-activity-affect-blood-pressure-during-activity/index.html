Does physical activity lower blood pressure: Exercise conditions the heart and improves the health of blood vessels. Men and the obese had a greater reactivity of systolic bp to activity; Diastolic pressure is the pressure in the blood vessels in between heartbeats at a relaxation point and would be the last twitch before the needle drops completely on the stethoscope.
