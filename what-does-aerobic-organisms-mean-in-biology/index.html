Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences From byjus.com
[ ār´ōb ] a microorganism that lives and grows in the presence of free oxygen. That is why some foods are touted as healthy because they are rich in antioxidants. However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal.

<p>Some species, called facultative anaerobes, are able to grow either with or without free oxygen. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Aerobic is a condition in which free oxygen or dissolved oxygen is present in an aquatic environment. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration. Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration Major Differences.</p>

<p>Most organisms need oxygen to survive. Although some aerobic organisms, such as animals, breathe in oxygen through lungs or gills, other organisms, like plants, fungi, and bacteria, are also aerobic. Aerobic respiration process takes place in all multicellular organisms including animals, plants and other living organisms. However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal.
