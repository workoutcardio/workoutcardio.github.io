Plus, with your glutes on the seat and your feet strapped in tight, you expose your body to minimal impact, lim says. Perform each exercise for 45 seconds, followed by 15 seconds of rest as you transition to the next exercise.

Because this is a beginner session, there are no push ups involved, however, exercises 2, 4, 6 and 7 will place a muscular isometric tension on the whole upper body.
