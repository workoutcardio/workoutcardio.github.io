Anaerobic vs Aerobic Exercise What&#39;s the Difference? Openfit From openfit.com
Anaerobic and aerobic energy systems are constantly activated to some extent, representing a continuum of. Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. The idea is that a lot of energy. During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (at).
