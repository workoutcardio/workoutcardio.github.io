The more time for which the person works out, the faster the results. If you are looking to lose fat using hiit, the results are 100% dependent on your ability to place yourself in a calorie deficit, which hiit can help with, but is not the only factor involved in weight loss. If your routine lasts more than 30 minutes, it is likely that you are not pushing yourself to your maximum intensity. If you&#39;re short on time but still want a good burn from your exercise routine, high intensity interval training (hiit) may be the best option for getting the most from your workouts.
