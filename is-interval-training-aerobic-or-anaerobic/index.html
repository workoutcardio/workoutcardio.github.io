Hence, aerobic exercise can be defined as the one, which involves the use of oxygen to produce energy, whereas anaerobic exercise makes the body to produce energy without using oxygen. During aerobic exercise, you breathe faster and deeper than when your heart rate is at rest. Calisthenics, such as jumps and squats; For example, you might complete a workout in about 15 to 20 minutes or less instead of 40 minutes.

<p>Unlike aerobic exercise, an immediate boost of energy is required by the body in anaerobic exercise. Interval training enables you to complete an effective workout in less time than a standard cardiovascular workout. Because interval training is intense, it is a great method for improving both aerobic and anaerobic fitness. Researchers studied the effects of 4 weeks of sprint interval training on aerobic and anaerobic performance in preseason iranian wrestlers.</p>
