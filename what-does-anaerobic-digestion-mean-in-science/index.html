<p>Anaerobic digestion is widely used for treating various waste streams such as municipal sludge or animal waste. In this instance, “organic” means coming from or made of plants or animals. The finished result of anaerobic processing is biogas, which is a blend of carbon dioxide, methane, and water. Anaerobic digestion can be described as biological oxidation of biodegradable waste by microbes under anaerobic conditions or in simpler terms it is the process of converting complex organic molecules into simpler molecules with the help of microorganisms in absence of oxygen.
