Sometimes a heart enzyme test can return to normal if the test is done soon after heart injury. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle. Troponin and creatinine phosphokinase (cpk) levels rise after a heart attack. This can happen during and after a heart attack.
