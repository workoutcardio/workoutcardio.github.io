<p>In intense exercise (&gt;80% v o 2max), unlike at lesser intensities, glucose is the exclusive muscle fuel.it must be mobilized from muscle and liver glycogen in both the fed and fasted states. In people with diabetes and in most people with type 2 diabetes, insulin levels in the blood fall during exercise, and the rise in glucagon released from the pancreas stimulates the liver to produce more glucose.

But, longo’s study showed a remarkable reversal of diabetes in mice who followed a fast for four days each week. However, the majority of the scientific literature suggests that it won’t help. It is for this reason that exercising soon after taking an insulin bolus or correction dose actually put you at a higher risk of dangerous hypoglycemia than working out when your insulin levels are low.
