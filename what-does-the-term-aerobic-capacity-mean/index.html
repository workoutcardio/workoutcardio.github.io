<p>Aerobic power refers to the maximum amount of oxygen a person can take in during exercise. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. Maximum aerobic work capacity (vo2 max) is a clinical standard for measuring cardiorespiratory efficiency in graduated stages by increasing the duration and intensity levels where the gaseous exchange between oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide expulsion reaches the maximum threshold to sustain physical exertion.
