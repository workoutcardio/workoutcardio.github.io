<p>It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time. Among the main characteristics of aerobic capacity we can find: Fitness tests or mathematical estimations.</p>

<p>Aerobic power refers to the maximum amount of oxygen a person can take in during exercise. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. Maximum aerobic work capacity (vo2 max) is a clinical standard for measuring cardiorespiratory efficiency in graduated stages by increasing the duration and intensity levels where the gaseous exchange between oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide expulsion reaches the maximum threshold to sustain physical exertion.

<p>This type of training is mainly. Aerobic activities do not require great physical effort. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). The more you work on your cardiovascular endurance, the higher your aerobic capacity or maximum oxygen uptake will be. Aerobic Capacity lesson 1.</p>
