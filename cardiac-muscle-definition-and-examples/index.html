Cardiac muscle is special because it has large cells with a single nucleus unlike skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle cells are branched with intercalated discs connecting them. Cardiac muscles have a branching pattern that allows them to relax when they need to fill with blood (unlike skeletal muscles). Cardiac muscle is one of three kinds of muscles, the others being skeletal and smooth. Cardiac muscles (this is the one we’ll focus on) here is an image of cardiac muscle under a microscope (image from.

Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is a striated muscle and much of the mechanism of contraction of the two muscle types is similar. The systole is not altered in length, but the diastole is very much prolonged, and since this is the period not only of cardiac rest but also of cardiac.

<p>Although it is a muscle, cardiac muscle does not move. The contraction of individual cardiac muscle cells produces force and shortening in these bands of muscle, with a resultant decrease in the heart chamber. Cardiac muscle is very different from skeletal muscle because it has a much more complex structure. A type of muscle tissue that is found only in the heart and is distinguishable from the two other forms of muscle, smooth muscle (that moves internal organs, such as the bowels, and vessels, such as the artery walls) and skeletal muscle (that powers joints).
