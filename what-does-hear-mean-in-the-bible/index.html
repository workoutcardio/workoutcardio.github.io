<p>In chapter three in the book of revelation, we read that jesus is standing at a door, knocking: “he who has knowledge spares his words, and a man of understanding is of a calm spirit.”. It starts, “hear, o israel! Every person is unique and different than other beings. 4 Ways to Know If You’re Hearing God’s Voice Copeland.</p>
<h3 id="2-as-all-this-is-latent-in-hearing-namely-obedience-and-faith-in-the-will-therefore-these-likewise-are-signified-in-common-speech-by-hearing-hearkening-and-attending">[2] As All This Is Latent In Hearing, Namely, Obedience And Faith In The Will, Therefore These Likewise Are Signified In Common Speech By Hearing, Hearkening, And Attending;</h3><p>Jesus also repeats the phrase, “he who has ears to hear, let him hear” over and over again in the gospels and the book of revelation. The ear receives the message of the gospel of jesus christ, and through the power of the holy spirit, faith begins in. It’s the punch line to each of the revelation letters as well as several of his parables. As hearing is the mode by which the son receives the father's word, and the son's immediate followers receive it from him, so hearing is the means by which each believer receives the word.</p>
<h3 id="according-to-the-bible-the-heart-is-the-centre-not-only-of-spiritual-activity-but-of-all-the-operations-of-human-life">According To The Bible, The Heart Is The Centre Not Only Of Spiritual Activity, But Of All The Operations Of Human Life.</h3><p>Jesus’ parable of the sower and the seed contrasts types of hearers: Faith,  says paul, comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of christ ( rom 10:17; Lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”. It is that which drives the will of man towards action.</p>
<h3 id="it-can-be-easy-to-miss">It Can Be Easy To Miss.</h3><p>Your heart is, essentially, you. And in the spiritual sense, faith in the will. This heart is the core of who you are as a person. The message is the meaning here.” (romans 10:17 commentary p 1930).</p>
<h3 id="it-means-spiritual-truth-comes-by-revelation">It Means Spiritual Truth Comes By Revelation.</h3><p>Hence it is that hearing signifies the understanding of a thing, and at the same time obedience; All scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, i will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with me.” revelation 3:20 (nasb) while the scripture is presented as a letter to the church as a whole, in. He says in verse 1, “draw near to hear.”.</p>
