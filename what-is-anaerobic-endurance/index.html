Still, training at or a little above anaerobic threshold intensity is known to improve both the aerobic capacity and the anaerobic threshold level. Often, aerobic endurance and muscular endurance are used interchangeably, but they are actually two different. Generally, these activities are of short length with high intensity. Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs.

The word “aerobic” means “with oxygen,” as this kind of exercise is fueled by the oxygen that. May help lower and control blood pressure. Scientists have explained the term in various ways, like, lactate threshold, ventilatory anaerobic threshold, onset of blood lactate accumulation, onset of plasma lactate accumulation, heart rate deflection point and maximum lactate steady state.

<p>The muscles have to rely on the stored reserves of fuel. Aerobic endurance is the ability to exercise for a long period of time without having to stop due to fatigue. Anaerobic endurance refers to the ability to sustain intense, short duration activity such as weight lifting or sprinting. The level of aerobic endurance is reflected by the length of time an aerobic exercise involving large muscle groups (e.g. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (AEROBICANAEROBIC EXERCISE) ΓΙΩΡΓΟΣ ΤΟΥΛΙΑΤΟΣ. Η.</p>

The biochemistry of anaerobic exercise involves a process called glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to adenosine triphosphate (atp), which is the primary source of energy for cellular reactions. The anaerobic energy system is the energy system of choice for the 100m sprinter. It doesn’t need oxygen to work and is the faster of the two processes.</p>
