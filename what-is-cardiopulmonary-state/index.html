<p>Patients often tried to breathe against the ventilator, leading to the well. As the name suggests, cardiopulmonary bypass is a technique of intercepting vemous blood as it enters the right atrium and diverting it into an excorporeal circuit (the heart/lung machine), where oxygen is added and carbon. If the mve is &gt; 85% of predicted (i.e., the ventilatory reserve is &lt; 15%), then the patient is abnormally limited by pulmonary disease. For example, when the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently, normal oxygen movement in the lungs is reduced, causing shortness of breath.</p>
