<p>We will break down %mhr into five different zones and provide general benefits of training in each zone. The majority of athletes could benefit from including some aerobic work. To train at this intensity, pick a form of exercise that allows you to easily control your heart rate, such as walking or cycling. They exist as separate zones entirely for practical reasons.
