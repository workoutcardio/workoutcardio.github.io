You should allot the same amount of time for face exercises if you’re skinny, but it would be enough for you to do aerobic exercise for just 30 minutes a day. Some of the good foods include food rich in crabs, butter sugar paste, milk, olive oil, apple paste and so on. Jogging and running are great exercises to help you lose weight. Once you’re done with the left cheek, perform the same for your right cheek 20 times.
