This exact amount is determined by amplitude (the size or height) of the sound or light wave. In physics, the intensity or flux of radiant energy is the power transferred per unit area, where the area is measured on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy.in the si system, it has units watts per square metre (w/m 2), or kg⋅s −3 in base units.intensity is used most frequently with waves such as acoustic waves or electromagnetic waves such as light or. For weight loss, the more intense or longer your activity, the more calories you burn. Extreme degree of strength, force, energy, or feeling.
