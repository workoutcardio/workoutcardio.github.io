The key difference between congestive heart failure and congenital heart disease is that congestive heart failure is a medical condition in the heart caused due to old age, while congenital heart disease is a medical condition in the heart caused due to birth defects. Of those cases, around four out of five patients with chf are over the age of 60. Congestive heart failure is a chronic disease that progresses with time if left untreated.</p>

Heart failure, sometimes called congestive cardiac failure (ccf), is a condition in which the heart muscle is weakened and can’t pump as well as it usually does. It usually occurs because the heart has become too weak or stiff. Ejection fraction is a measure of this pumping force in the left ventricle of the heart.</p>
