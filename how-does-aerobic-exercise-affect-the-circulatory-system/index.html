Oxygen (which makes up 21 percent of the air we breathe) is then passed from. Also, after anaerobic training such as sprinting your heart rate stays elevated for several hours. By maintaining the aerobic phase of exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a week, the cardiorespiratory system can improve in. It does this by increasing your heart&#39;s capacity to send blood (and hence oxygen) to the muscles.

<p>Also, first improve your cardio via some basic aerobic training, before stepping up the intensity with fast paced cardio exercises. Exercise causes the heart to pump blood into the circulation more efficiently as a result of more forceful and efficient myocardial contractions, increased perfusion of tissues and organs with blood, and increased oxygen delivery. It does this by increasing your heart's capacity to send blood (and hence oxygen) to the muscles.
