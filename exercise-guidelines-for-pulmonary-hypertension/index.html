<p>According to the “ recommendations for exercise in patients with pah ” consensus statement, issued by the pulmonary hypertension association (pha)’s scientific leadership council, patients should discuss their limitations and capacities with a ph specialist first. Patients on fluid restriction should ask for more specific advice from their physician. Pulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic condition defined by an increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mpap) to at least 25 mm hg, which can result in dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance ().as patients with pulmonary hypertension often present with these nonspecific symptoms, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) can be a useful tool to suggest a. Recent guidelines on pulmonary hypertension also support the use of exercise training in physically deconditioned patients.</p>
