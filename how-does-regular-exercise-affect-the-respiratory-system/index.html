<p>The lungs cannot move on their own. To meet this increased demand, the body responds by breathing deeper and more frequently in order to take in the necessary oxygen. They send that blood down to the ventricles, which send it out to the lungs or the rest of the body. The skeletal muscles that control respiration include your diaphragm and intercostals.
