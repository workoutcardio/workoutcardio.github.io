<p>Even if your children are too young to really understand the concept, they’ll still love watching different layers form when you add liquids of different densities to a glass and how different objects float on the different layers. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities play a major role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease. The more matter (mass) within a space (volume) means that the object is denser.
