How Does Heart Rate Change with Exercise by Avery Ward From prezi.com
Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week). By susan paretts updated june 21, 2018. To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate.
