Why Do Athletes Have a Lower Heart Rate? From livestrong.com
These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Like a metronome, it generates a rhythmic electrical signal that stimulates the heart muscle to contract. So your heart rate will still rise with exercise, but it won&#39;t have to rise as much. The heart responds to the increased demand by pumping more blood through the body—this increased flow of blood results in an increased heart.

<p>This makes you breathe faster to keep up with the intake and removal of the gases during respiration. Your cardiac output increases along with your stroke volume because of the rise in blood flow to your muscles when you exercise. Your baseline heart rate is established by the sinoatrial node, or sa node, often called the heart's pacemaker. This cardiovascular drift occurs as you lose water through sweating and as your heart directs more blood to your skin in order to cool you down.
