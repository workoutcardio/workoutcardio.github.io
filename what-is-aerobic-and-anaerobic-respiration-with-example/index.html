biochemistry How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic From biology.stackexchange.com
This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Anaerobic respiration is a kind of respiration process which doesn’t require o2 molecule as electron acceptor or simply we can say that anaerobic respiration occurs in absence of oxygen. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the absence of oxygen gas. It doesn’t need oxygen to work and is the faster of the two processes.
