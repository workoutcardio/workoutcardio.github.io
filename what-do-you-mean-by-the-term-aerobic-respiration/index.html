<p>Cellular respiration is of two types, i.e. Anaerobic respiration occurs mostly in prokaryotes. It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen: Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen.

<p>This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Most of the plant and animal cells use aerobic respiration. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration.

<p>Respiration is the process which involves exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the organism and the environment. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (o2) in order to create atp. Aerobic &amp; anaerobic respiration.</p>

<p>Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). The process uses a respiratory electron transport chain but does not use oxygen as the electron acceptors. State The Balanced Chemical Equation For Cellular Respiration.</p>
