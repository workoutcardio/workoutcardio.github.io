<p>Resting heart rate, measured in beats per minute, is your heart rate while at rest. For adults, a ‘normal’ rhr ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, although most people who are relaxed and healthy should be below 90. Adjustment for resting heart rate reduced the inverse association of arterial stiffness with cardiorespiratory fitness by 93.7% (men) and 67.6% (women) but substantially increased the positive association of arterial stiffness with muscular strength among women and revealed a positive association of arterial stiffness with muscular strength.
