<p>Interval training works both the aerobic and the anaerobic systems. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. What is anaerobic training effect strength training. The training groups met three times per week in 45 min sessions aimed at improving either cardiovascular endurance or muscle strength.
