The bacteria growing in test tube 2 are obligate anaerobes because they grow at the bottom of the test tube, away from the oxygen. It may react negatively or even die if free oxygen is present. As we mentioned earlier, the most prominent point of difference between these two, is the fact that aerobic bacteria require oxygen to survive, while anaerobic bacteria don’t. However, some aerobic bacteria can grow in the absence of oxygen as they are able to use fermentation or anaerobic respiration.

<p>These bacteria are called anaerobic because they don't need oxygen to grow. Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria can occur almost anywhere in your body. The facultative anaerobic bacteria are those bacteria that can survive and grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In humans, these bacteria generally live in the gastrointestinal tract, but they may also be found in other places outside the body, including in the soil and water, in foods, and in animals.
