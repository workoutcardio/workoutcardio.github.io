Cardiac Cycle in cardiovascular system. All 7 Phases explained in short From youtube.com
The bottom tip of the heart, known as its apex, is turned to the left, so that about 2/3 of the heart is located on the body’s left side with the other 1/3 on right. Is when a blood vessel narrows, making it harder for blood to flow through it. The circulatory system, also called cardiovascular system, is a vital organ system that delivers essential substances to all cells for basic functions to occur. For example, blood vessels supplying the brain constitute the cerebral circulation while those supplying the kidneys form the renal circulation.
