If an individual is interested in a combined training program, one recommendation is to include 2 days of aerobic training per week and 2 days of strength training per week. When you begin to exercise your body must immediately adjust to the change in activity level. After you feel you have made some positive progress, try and push yourself so that you’re increasing your difficulty rating to the 4 to 6 range. As you begin your aerobic training, try to exert yourself so that you’re rating your workout between a 3 and 4.
