What are the functions of the digestive system? The opening and closing of the sphincter is controlled by peristaltic waves produced by the stomach during the digestion process. In the eye, the pupillary sphincter in the iris opens and closes to. The lower esophageal (cardioesophageal) sphincter relaxes when a bolus of food travels down the esophagus.

<p>The cardiac sphincter that lies at the lower end of the esophagus acts like a valve that ensures unidirectional flow of ingested food. The contents of the stomach are highly acidic and can burn the esophagus, which is what causes the symptoms of heartburn. It also prevents stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus.
