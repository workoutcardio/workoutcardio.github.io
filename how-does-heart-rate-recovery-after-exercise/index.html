Heart rate (HR) recovery after 6min submaximal exercise performed From researchgate.net
Heart rate recovery has been found to be a powerful tool in predicting cardiovascular insufficiencies that can ultimately lead to heart disease and mortality. The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. Hr recovery is measured after performing strenuous exercise for a given period of time and then measuring how far your heart rate drops two minutes after stopping that exercise. Again, those with an abnormal heart rate recovery (defined in this case as a drop of 42 beats per.
