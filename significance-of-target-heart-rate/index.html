When you are at rest, your heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood to supply the oxygen your body&#39;s needs. After each physical activity below, provide the students 1 to 2 minutes to let their heart rate recover before starting the next activity. Then, count the number of beats in 30 seconds. In order to determine target heart rate, the maximum heart rate is obtained by subtracting the person&#39;s age from 220.
