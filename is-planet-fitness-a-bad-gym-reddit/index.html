Planet fitness is a gym that preys on peoples&#39; gym insecurities, particularly those new to working out. I never in my life wanted to grunt while exercising until i felt sheer force bearing down on my chest and needing to lift it. But you can 100% get in great shape there.

<p>If you’re looking for more amenities or plan to do any serious weight lifting, i wouldn’t recommend. Planet fitness is hands down the most affordable gym membership available right now. While this mindset is not bad and stays true to the gym’s mantra, it’s bad for true workouts and fitness buffs. So, generally, i think planet fitness is fine especially if you're on a budget, but only to a point.</p>
