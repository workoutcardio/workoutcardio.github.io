Planet fitness is a gym that preys on peoples&#39; gym insecurities, particularly those new to working out. I never in my life wanted to grunt while exercising until i felt sheer force bearing down on my chest and needing to lift it. But you can 100% get in great shape there. Most people are better off going to another gym.

<p>If youâre looking for more amenities or plan to do any serious weight lifting, i wouldnât recommend. Planet fitness is hands down the most affordable gym membership available right now. While this mindset is not bad and stays true to the gymâs mantra, itâs bad for true workouts and fitness buffs. So, generally, i think planet fitness is fine especially if you're on a budget, but only to a point.</p>
