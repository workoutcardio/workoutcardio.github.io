Some people (like me and you, i guess) have higher resting heart rates, so just getting up and moving around kicks us up into what fitbit figures is the fat burn zone. If your resting hr is that high through the day, i can see why it thinks your body is in fat burn zone a lot. Here are the three heart rate zones that show up in your fitbit app. Does anyone else’s Fitbit constantly say they’re in the fat burn zone.</p>

<p>Fitbit bases its landmark heart rates (max heart rate, cardio and fat burn zone) based on your max being 220 minus your age but obviously that won't work for everyone. My “resting” heart rate has been steadily increasing from the 70s to the 80s but i think the fitbit thinks i’m exercising when i’m. It is at that point that the researcher concluded that fitbits and other trackers cannot give accurate calorie burn. Based on those criteria, other pieces of personal information, and workout results, a fitbit watch can determine your overall cardio fitness level. What Is Lean Vs Fat On Fitbit ISWATQ.</p>
