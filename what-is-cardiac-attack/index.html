Heart attack is when the blood flowing to the heart is blocked, but the functioning of the heart is intact. A heart attack is a “circulation” problem and sudden cardiac arrest is an “electrical” problem. A heart attack most commonly results from atherosclerosis (fatty buildups) in the arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle. The heart muscle is robbed of its vital blood supply and, if left untreated, will begin to die because it is not getting enough oxygen.
