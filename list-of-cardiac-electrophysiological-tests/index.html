Electrophysiology studies (eps) are tests that help doctors understand the nature of abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ). Indrajit choudhuri, masood akhtar, in electrophysiological disorders of the heart (second edition), 2012. Each catheter has two or more electrodes to measure the heart’s electrical signals as they travel from one chamber to another. Eps is the gold standard diagnostic study for the evaluation of many arrhythmias.

An electrophysiology (ep) study — also called invasive cardiac electrophysiology — is a series of tests that examine the heart's electrical activity. This movement of the heart creates the heartbeat, or heart rhythm. Included are the identification of a patient population amenable to ep testing, a routine setup for ep testing, and the common protocols performed during ep testing. Electrophysiology.</p>

<p>Michigan medicine cardiologist venkatesh murthy, m.d., offers a guide to the various noninvasive tests your doctor may order, including what they’re designed to do. An electrophysiology (ep) study is a test performed to assess your heart's electrical system or activity and is used to diagnose abnormal heartbeats or arrhythmia.

<p>The heart's electrical system produces signals (impulses) that control the timing of the heartbeats. Natural electrical impulses coordinate contractions of the different parts of the heart. An electrophysiological (or electrophysiologic) study is the most accurate and reliable method of evaluating heart rhythms, allowing doctors to assess.
