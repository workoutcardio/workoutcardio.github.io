Humming bee breath, also known as bhramari pranayama, is a breathing exercise that incorporates humming. Place one hand on your belly and one on your chest. When you smoke, the structure of your lung changes, making it harder for your lungs to expand and contract the way they normally do during breathing. A few deep breath holds can help prime the lungs and make sure all the units are open and functioning at their optimal capacity.
