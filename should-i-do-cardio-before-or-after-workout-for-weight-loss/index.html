Should You Do Cardio Before or After Weights? 1AND1 Life 1AND1 Life From 1and1life.com
I’ve learned that lifting before cardio is much better for fat loss and workout energy efficiency. If you want to increase endurance, then do cardio first. Experts say that even at a low intensity, cardiovascular exercise can help you lose weight because it can keep you in the fat burning zone/aerobic training zone. But if you push through and do some light weight, high rep exercises, you increase muscular endurance.
