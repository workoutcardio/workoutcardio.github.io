Treadmill Exercise Stress Test Garani Cardiac Centre From garanicardiac.ca
It involves closely monitoring the electrocardiogram (ekg) while the patient exercises on a treadmill. Robert bruce, who invented it in the 1950s, is the most widely used protocol during exercise treadmill tests. A treadmill stress test, also known as a graded exercise test (gxt) is used to determine if the heart muscle is receiving an adequate blood supply under conditions of stress. Exercise allows doctors to detect abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and diagnose the presence or absence of coronary artery disease.
