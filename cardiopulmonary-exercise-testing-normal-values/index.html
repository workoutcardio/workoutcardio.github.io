<p>This study aimed to explore the diagnostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) and the oxygen uptake kinetics indexes of cpet. Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests are often conducted in patients a known clinical with diagnosis. I.e., one metabolic equivalent equals 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body.
