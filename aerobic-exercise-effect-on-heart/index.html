<p>These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Regular exercise has a favorable effect on many of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle.
