Skeletal muscle releases ammonia during exercise, and exercise scientists have long suspected that it is a contributing factor to fatigue. Muscle fatigue is the decline in ability of muscles to generate force.it can be a result of vigorous exercise but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction.there are two main causes of muscle fatigue: Muscle biopsies were obtained from the biceps brachii before and after one set of 12 repetitions to muscular failure at 80% of the 1rm (37 seconds).
