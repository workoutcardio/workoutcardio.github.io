CO2 emissions by fuel Our World in Data From ourworldindata.org
Carbon dioxide (co2) emissions by country in the world with global share of co2 greenhouse emissions by country. Global efforts to tackle climate change are way off track says the un, as it details the first rise in co2 emissions in four years. The primary source of co. In order to allow people to better understand how damaging some human activities are for the environment, we have coined terms like ‘carbon emissions’ and ‘carbon footprint’.
