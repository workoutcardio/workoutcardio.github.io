<p>Power in its simplest form is the product of force multiplied by distance, divided by time. Muscle power is defined as the product of muscle strength and muscle contractile velocity (work per unit time), and since daily living involves dynamic muscle action, loss of muscle power could have a greater impact on functional muscle limitation than muscle weakness per se [54]. Muscle power is one of the main fitness components, important for success in many sports. Timed get up &amp; go test; Definition For Muscular Strength definitionus.</p>

In a sporting context, force can be substituted for strength, and time/distance indicated by the speed of movement. Strength, power, muscular endurance, and conditioning are all expressions of muscular ability, as well as overall physical ability, in one way or another.while overlap occurs from one to the next, there are clear differences between each form of muscular output.
