<p>Arteries carry blood away from the heart while veins carry blood into the heart. Cardiac electrophysiology is a specialized procedure in which one or more thin, flexible wires, called catheters are inserted into a blood vessel (usually the groin) and guided into the heart. The external structures of the heart include the ventricles, atria, arteries and veins. An electrophysiological (or electrophysiologic) study is the most accurate and reliable method of evaluating heart rhythms, allowing doctors to assess.

<p>Most often, these kinds of tests are performed on older people, but younger people with congenital heart conditions can. Each catheter has two or more electrodes to measure the heartâs electrical signals as they travel from one chamber to another. If you've been diagnosed with a heart rhythm disorder, you might know about cardiac electrophysiology. This helps keep blood flowing the way it should.
