<p>This heart rate reading is a good indicator of your cardiovascular health. An athlete’s resting heart rate, for instance, is typically around 40 bpm. The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max.
