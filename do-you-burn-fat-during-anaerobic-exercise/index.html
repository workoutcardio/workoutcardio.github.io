<p>During anaerobic exercise, oxygen consumption is not sufficient to supply the energy demands being placed on your muscles, so your muscles begin to break down sugars, resulting in higher lactic acid production. Our muscles are primed to burn fat, and it is our most concentrated form of energy. But if you had to choose one, the answer is anaerobic. While aerobic exercises boost cardiac health and stamina, anaerobic workouts help you gain lean muscles while burning fat, so the balance of both really is best.</p>
