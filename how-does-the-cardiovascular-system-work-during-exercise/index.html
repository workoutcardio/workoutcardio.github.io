Transport nutrients, hormones, gases and waste to and from our cells. Oxygen is needed for many types of exercise. During exercise, the job of the cardiovascular system is to deliver blood and oxygen from the heart and lungs to your working muscles. The result is tachycardia, an increased stroke volume, and an increase in blood pressure.
