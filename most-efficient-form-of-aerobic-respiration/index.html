More detailed differences between the two are as follows: The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Aerobic respiration is the most efficient form of respiration as it can produce the most atp molecules, or, in other words, release the most energy from the breaking down of the glucose molecules and store it in the body&amp; #39 ;s energy molecules atp.

<p>If you look at 1 mol which is 180 grams of pure glucose then it can burn or oxidise or react with oxygen to release 686 kcal of energy as heat. The general process of aerobic respiration can be expressed as: Theoretically, there can be a net gain of 38 atp molecules by the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule in aerobic respiration.

<p>Theoretically, there can be a net gain of 38 atp molecules by the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule in aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration takes place in mitochondria. Aerobic activities can generate up to 38 atp per gram of glucose. Note that respiration is different to breathing (ventilation). 2.8 cellular respiration.</p>

<p>In aerobic respiration, atp forms as electrons are harvested and transferred along the electron transport chain, and eventually donated to oxygen gas. Anaerobic reactions produce just 2 atp per gram of glucose. In this second phase of aerobic respiration, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted.

<p>Subsequently the term respiration was used in a wider sense including breathing, transport of gases as well as the oxidation of food leading to liberation of co 2 and energy. Theoretically, there can be a net gain of 38 atp molecules by the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule in aerobic respiration. Note that respiration is different to breathing (ventilation). In these organisms, the type of cellular respiration takes place is called aerobic respiration. During Cellular Respiration Energy Is D In The Form Of Energy Etfs.</p>
