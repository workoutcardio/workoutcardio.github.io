It has been shown to reduce body fat, increase basal metabolic rate, decrease blood pressure and the cardiovascular demands to. The aim of this study was to carry out a literature review on the overall benefits of resistance training (rt) after stroke and undertake a critical analysis of the resistance exercise programs surveyed (rest interval between sets and exercises, number of sets, number of repetitions, intensity, duration of training, and weekly frequency). Resistance training is recommended by national health organizations for incorporation into a comprehensive fitness program that includes aerobic and flexibility exercise. The increasing number of youth who are involved in sport activities, coupled with the health problems of inactivity and being overweight, have resulted in increased interest.
